    <p class="centeredText">So, what is all this?</p>
    <p class="centeredText">I modified a fridge to grow mushrooms in it. It was fun. This site shows the current temperature and humidity in the fridge, it contains documentation on how I built everything and how you might be able to as well.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">Cooking is something that brings me a lot of joy, so does rasing plants. Being able to grow my own food has been a very nice experience and I hope some people who read this will be inspired to try to do something like this themselves.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">This Project was inspired by the People at the Finish Startup Helsieni.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">I took part in their Mushroom growing workshop and they mentioned modifying a fridge to grow mushrooms.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">This immediately intrigued me. This would allow me, someone with limited space, to grow some food for myself.</p>
    <p class="centeredText"><a href="https://www.helsieni.fi/en/blog/2016/06/22/osce-days-helsinki-2016-growfridge/#oscitas-slider-1">In this Blog-Post</a> they talk about how they did a workshop helping others to build a growfridge themselves.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">I decided that I wanted to expand on their project to better fit my wants and needs.</p>
    <p class="centeredText"></p>
    <p class="centeredText">The changes I wanted to make mainly focused on the following:</p>
    <p class="centeredText">1. Replacing the control components with an arduino and appropriate sensors.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">2. Allowing easy control for light, humidity and temperature through a visual interface.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">3. Make this project reproducible for others that are interested by making my code and setup open source.</p>
    <p class="centeredText"></p>
    <p class="centeredText">To address the first point, I selected an arduino mega as my control board and a DHT-22 as my temperature and humidity sensor.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">The sensor and internal counters in the arduino are used to control a relais board, which then turns things like the fridge or the light on or off.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">While you could use a pre-made humidifier to get water vapor into the fridge, I decided to build my own, using a ultrasonic fogger as the base.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">Regarding point two, for the visual interface I used a 20x4 LCD display and 4 keyboard switches to change settings.<p>
    <p class="centeredText">To contain the display and buttons I designed a model that can be 3D printed and be used to mount these parts.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">The third was also very important to me. Having the code and some instructions others can follow will hopefully contribute a small bit to the ever growing amateur mushroom growing community.</p>
    <p class="centeredText">You can find all of the Code, diagrams, a parts list and the stl file for 3d printing <a href="https://github.com/x86Enthusiast/Growfridge/">HERE</a> at my github</p>
    <p class="centeredText"></p>
